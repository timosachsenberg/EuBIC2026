    "1. **Get acquainted with `pyopenms` and enzymatic digestion**  \n",
    "   - Load a small **FASTA file** (a text format for storing protein/nucleotide sequences) with a few protein sequences  \n",
    "   - Perform an **in-silico** (computational, as opposed to in a wet lab) **Trypsin** digestion  \n",
    "   - Generate realistic bottom-up **peptides** with length and missed-cleavage constraints  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Take a first look at typical LC–MS data**  \n",
    "   - Load an **mzML file** (an open XML format for mass spectrometry data)  \n",
    "   - Visualize the data as a 2D **peak map (heatmap)**  \n",
    "   - Extract and plot a **single MS1 spectrum**  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Zoom into isotope patterns**  \n",
    "   - Find an **isotope pattern** of an analyte  \n",
    "   - Estimate the **charge state** and **mass** of the analyte  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Compute the Total Ion Chromatogram (TIC)**  \n",
    "   - Calculate the **TIC** as the sum of all ion intensities over time  \n",
    "   - Interpret the axes and what the TIC tells us about the LC–MS run\n",

    "**The Biochemistry Behind Trypsin Specificity**\n",

    "Trypsin is a serine protease with a negatively charged binding pocket (aspartate residue at position 189). This pocket attracts the positively charged side chains of:\n",

    "Change the enzyme from Trypsin to another protease. Try:\n",
    "- `\"Chymotrypsin\"` - cleaves after F, W, Y\n",

    "3. Compare: would this peptide be longer or shorter than our +2 example?\n",
