Iterating over collections:**\n```python\nfor entry in entries:         # Loop through each item\n    print(entry.identifier)   # Access properties with dot notation\n```\n\n**3. List operations:**\n```python\npeptides = []                 # Empty list\npeptides[:5]                  # First 5 items (slicing)\nlen(peptides)                 # Count items\n```\n\n**4. f-strings for formatting:**\n```python\nprint(f\"Found {len(peptides)} peptides\")  # Variables inside {}\n```\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Deep Dive: Why Does Trypsin Cleave After K and R?</b></summary>\n\n**The Biochemistry Behind Trypsin Specificity**\n\nTrypsin is a serine protease with a negatively charged binding pocket (aspartate residue at position 189). This pocket attracts the positively charged side chains of:\n\n- **Lysine (K)**: Has a positively charged amino group (-NH3+)\n- **Arginine (R)**: Has a positively charged guanidinium group\n\n```\nTrypsin cleavage sites:\n\n    ...Ala─Lys─┃─Glu...     Cleaves after Lys (K)\n              ↓\n    ...Ala─Arg─┃─Asp...     Cleaves after Arg (R)\n              ↓\n    ...Ala─Lys─╳─Pro...     Does NOT cleave before Pro (P)\n```\n\n**Why not before Proline?**\n\nProline's cyclic structure creates a rigid kink in the peptide backbone that prevents proper positioning in trypsin's active site. This is called the \"proline rule.\"\n\n**Why is this useful for proteomics?**\n\nTryptic peptides have predictable properties:\n- End with K or R (except C-terminus) → good for MS/MS fragmentation\n- Average length ~10-15 amino acids → ideal for LC-MS\n- Generate charge states +2 to +4 → optimal for detection\n\n</details>",

The next peak (to the right) at ~408.26 m/z corresponds to the molecule with one additional neutron in one of its atoms. We don't know which atom in each molecule has the additional neutron—it could be any. This means that the many ions recorded to form this isotopic peak are likely a mixture of many isotopic variants of the molecule, each with an additional neutron. \n\nThe spacing between the isotopic peaks is ~0.5 m/z. We know that a neutron adds ~1.0 Da (or u). If we observe a spacing of 0.5 m/z, it tells us that the charge z of the ion is +2.",

You learned:\n\n| Topic | Key Concept | pyOpenMS Tools |\n|-------|-------------|----------------|\n| **Protein digestion** | Trypsin cleaves after K/R (not before P) | `ProteaseDigestion`, `AASequence` |\n| **MS data loading** | mzML files contain spectra with m/z and intensity | `MSExperiment`, `MzMLFile` |\n| **2D visualization** | Peak maps show RT vs m/z with intensity as color | `get_peaks()`, matplotlib |\n| **Isotope patterns** | Spacing = 1/charge; used to determine charge state | Interactive zoom |\n| **TIC chromatogram** | Sum of intensities over time shows elution profile | `np.sum()` on peaks |\n\n---\n\n## Bonus Challenges\n\nTest your understanding with these optional challenges:\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Challenge 1 (Beginner): Try a Different Enzyme</b></summary>\n\nChange the enzyme from Trypsin to another protease. Try:\n- `\"Chymotrypsin\"` - cleaves after F, W, Y\n- `\"Lys-C\"` - cleaves only after K\n- `\"Asp-N\"` - cleaves before D\n\n```python\ndigestion.setEnzyme(\"Chymotrypsin\")  # Try this!\n```\n\n**Questions:**\n1. How does the number of peptides change?\n2. How does the average peptide length change?\n3. Why might you choose one enzyme over another?\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Challenge 2 (Intermediate): Find Another Isotope Pattern</b></summary>\n\nExplore the spectrum to find a +3 charged ion:\n\n1. Look for isotope peaks spaced ~0.33 m/z apart\n2. Calculate the neutral mass\n3. Compare: would this peptide be longer or shorter than our +2 example?\n\n**Hint**: Higher charge states are often seen for larger peptides because they have more basic residues (K, R, H) to accept protons.\n\n</details>\n\n<details>\n<summary><b>Challenge 3 (Advanced): Calculate Base Peak Chromatogram</b></summary>\n\nInstead of TIC (sum of all intensities), calculate the **Base Peak Chromatogram (BPC)**:\n- For each spectrum, record only the **maximum intensity peak**\n- Plot max_intensity vs RT\n\n```python\n# Your code here - modify the TIC code\nbpc_rts = []\nbpc_intensities = []\n\nfor spec in exp:\n    if spec.getMSLevel() == 1:\n        rt = spec.getRT()\n        mzs, ints = spec.get_peaks()\n        max_intensity = ???  # What NumPy function gives the maximum?\n        bpc_rts.append(rt)\n        bpc_intensities.append(max_intensity)\n```\n\n**Question**: How does the BPC compare to the TIC? When might you prefer one over the other?\n\n</details>\n\n---\n\n**Next up: [Notebook 2 - Peptide Identification](EUBIC_Task2_ID.ipynb)** - Learn how to identify which peptides produced the spectra you just visualized!",
