    "1. **Get acquainted with `pyopenms` and enzymatic digestion**  \n",
    "   - Load a small FASTA file with a few protein sequences  \n",

    "2. **Take a first look at typical LC–MS data**  \n",
    "   - Load an mzML file with **MS1 spectra**  \n",
    "   - Visualize the data as a 2D **peak map (heatmap)**  \n",
    "   - Extract and plot a **single MS1 spectrum**  \n",

    "3. **Zoom into isotope patterns**  \n",

    "4. **Compute the Total Ion Current (TIC)**  \n",

    "We can see a clear isotope pattern. The peak at ~ 645.83 m/z is the lightest peak in the pattern and likely the monoisotopic peak. If we assume the peak at ~645.83 is indeed the peak of the monoisotopic molecule. The next peak (to the right) at ~646.33 corresponds to the molecule with one additional neutron in one of its atoms. We don't know which atom in each molecule has the additional neutron. It could be any. This means that the many ions that were recorded to form this isotopic peak, are likely a mixture of many isotopic variants of the molecule - each one with an additional neutron. The peak between the isotopic peaks are ~0.5 m/z. We know that a neutron adds ~1.0 Da (or u). If we observe a difference of 0.5 it tells us that the charge z of the ion is two."
