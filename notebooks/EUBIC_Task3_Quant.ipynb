    "> **Prerequisites**: This notebook builds on [Notebook 1 - From Proteins to Spectra](EUBIC_Task1_Peaks.ipynb) and [Notebook 2 - Peptide Identification](EUBIC_Task2_ID.ipynb). You should be familiar with MS1 spectra, peptide identification, and PSMs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we demonstrate a complete feature detection and annotation workflow using the OpenMS implementation of Biosaur2, an isotope-aware feature detection algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is quantification?** In proteomics, quantification refers to measuring the abundance of peptides or proteins in a sample. This is typically done by integrating the MS1 signal intensity over the elution time of each peptide, producing a value proportional to the amount of that peptide present.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What is feature detection?** Feature detection groups related peaks across multiple spectra into a single entity called a \"feature\". Unlike peak picking (which finds peaks in individual spectra), feature detection tracks signals across retention time, recognizing that the same peptide ion produces peaks in consecutive scans as it elutes from the LC column.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply the Biosaur2 algorithm to detect isotope-resolved features from mzML data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Annotate the feature map with peptide identifications.**\n",
    "\n",

    "<summary><b>How Does Feature Detection Differ From Peak Picking?</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peak Picking** (per-spectrum):\n",
    "\n",
    "Peak picking converts the raw signal intensities recorded by the ion detector (profile data) into discrete m/z values (centroided data). Each continuous peak profile is reduced to a single m/z position representing its intensity-weighted center.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Feature Detection** (cross-spectrum):\n",
    "\n",
    "![Feature detection illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timosachsenberg/EuBIC2026/main/notebooks/images/feature.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*A feature represents a peptide ion tracked across retention time. The feature boundaries are defined by the m/z range spanning the isotope pattern (monoisotopic peak plus heavier isotopes) and the RT range spanning the chromatographic elution profile.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature detection provides:\n",
    "- Single quantitative value per peptide ion (i.e., per peptide observed with a specific charge state)\n",
    "- Charge state inference from isotope pattern\n",
    "- Noise filtering (signals must persist over time)\n",
    "- Ready for quantitative comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "</details>\n",
    "\n",
    "<details>\n",
    "<summary><b>Why Use Integrated Intensity for Quantification?</b></summary>\n",
    "\n",
    "Integrating the signal over the entire elution profile (area under the curve) rather than using a single intensity value (e.g., apex intensity) provides more robust and comparable quantification across samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key advantage**: Slight differences in chromatography between experiments can cause peak broadening or sharpening, changing the apex intensity. However, the integrated area remains constant because the same total amount of analyte elutes - it's just spread over a wider or narrower time window.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Peak broadening illustration](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/timosachsenberg/EuBIC2026/main/notebooks/images/peak_broadening.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Both samples contain the same peptide amount, but apex intensities differ. Integrated intensities correctly show equal abundance.\n",

    "**Biosaur2** ([Ivanov et al., 2024](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00513)) is an isotope-aware feature detection method that identifies peptide features by clustering peaks across retention time and evaluating their isotopic patterns and charge state consistency. This strategy enables reliable discrimination between true peptide signals and background noise, particularly in complex LC–MS datasets. The algorithm has been implemented in OpenMS and is available through pyOpenMS as `Biosaur2Algorithm`.\n",

    "\n",

    "<summary>Answer</summary>\n",

    "- Peptide had low MS1 signal (below feature detection threshold)\n",
    "- MS2 was acquired during co-elution with another peptide (chimeric)\n",
    "- Feature detection parameters were too strict\n",
